The old files (marked (OLD)) worked well in automatically setting up the calendar, however, 
changing it beyond that proved dificult, especially for events, so I tried to remake the whole thing.  
As you can see, it is not quite complete, but making changes to it should be easier now.
I kept the old files in case we find a way to salvage them, but till then, I will be working on the (NEW) ones.
